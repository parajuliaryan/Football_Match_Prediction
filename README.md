# ⚽ Football Match Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict football match outcomes (Win, Draw, or Loss) based on **English Premier League (EPL) data from 2000 to 2021**. The model analyzes historical match statistics to make accurate predictions.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python 🐍**
- **XGBoost ⚡**
- **Logistic Regression 📈**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🏆**
- **Pandas & NumPy 🔢**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊**

## 🔍 Features
✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
✅ Model training and evaluation
✅ Performance comparison of ML models

## 📂 Notebook
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`football_match_prediction.ipynb`).

## 🎯 Results
- Evaluates model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**
- Provides insights into factors influencing match outcomes
- Compares ML models to determine the best-performing algorithm
